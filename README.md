# Linked-List-Object-Oriented-Programming
Creating a Linked List for Object Oriented Programming

This project was to familiarize myself with a basic data structure of a Linked List 
such as: how to create nodes, how to traverse a linked list, how to insert a node 
in the front, back, and anywhere else in the list, how to traverse a list by creating
iterators, and how basic data structurs like a stack and heap work.
